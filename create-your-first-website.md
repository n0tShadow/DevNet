# Create your first website

Building your first website can be both exciting and a bit daunting. Here's a simple guide to help you get started:

### Steps to Create Your Website

1. **Choose a Domain Name**: Pick a unique and memorable name for your website.
2. **Write the base code:** This is the basic code for websites:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>My First website!</h1>
        <p>Hello and welcome to my first website! Here, you can find lots of contents!</p>
        <a href="devnet-1.gitbook.io/devnet">This is where I learned how to make it!</a>
    </body>
</html>
```

3. **Upload it on hosting**: To upload it, download [FileZilla](./) and upload it. More you can find in [Filezilla Wiki](https://wiki.filezilla-project.org/Using).

### Tips

* **Test the Website**: Check on different devices for compatibility issues.
* **Regular Updates**: Keep content fresh and updated to maintain visitor interest.



### Warnings

* Domain name is paid.
* Hosting is also paid.
* There is no CSS, so it looks ugly.
* There is no JS.

With these steps, you're on your way to launching your first website. Happy building!
